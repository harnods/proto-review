 * tabs, so without this a comment left on one tab shows on all of them.
 *
 * We fold a small allowlist of "view-defining" query params (default: `tab`)
 * into the annotation's route key and stored path, so comments scope to the
 * tab they were made on. Transient params (?saved=1, ?page=2, ?review) are
 * ignored so they don't fragment threads.
